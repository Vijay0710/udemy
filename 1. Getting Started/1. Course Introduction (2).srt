00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,540
Welcome to my complete guide to angulars, it's great to have you in this course.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,860
You'll learn what an angular is and how you can use it to build great front end web applications

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,310
with him.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,390
Highly reactive web application with great user experience to it during this course.

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,940
You will learn all of the individual building blocks that make up the corners before us later too

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,480
dive into these more advanced features.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,880
And we will build a project throughout the course putting all the things you will learn

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,650
in theory where you practice throughout the course into a real project perspective so you can see

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,800
how are you going to apply it there.

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:48,670
And it's like you can see how you build real web applications with the things you learn here.

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,780
So with that I say let's dive into that and let's dive into the most important question first.

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,260
What's an angular?
